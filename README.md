## ðŸ’¡ Introduction

**Problem Statement**: Addressing Mental Health Gaps Through Technology

Millions globally face mental health challenges, yet timely and effective support remains scarce due to stigma, lack of awareness, and limited resources. Many regions lack access to qualified professionals, reliable information, and holistic wellness tools.  

Existing solutions often miss integrated care, such as hospital locators, medical record management, crisis support, relaxation tools, mental health exercises, and emergency protocols. There is a growing need for an accessible, user-friendly platform that bridges these gaps.

**Solution**: **BeyondPeace** is an Android app addressing mental health challenges by offering holistic support through nearby hospital locators, medical report storage, brain music therapy, and relaxation exercises. The platform promotes mental wellness, accessibility, and emergency assistance, contributing to the UN's Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being by 2030. BeyondPeace empowers users with innovative tools to foster emotional resilience and create a supportive community for better mental health outcomes.
